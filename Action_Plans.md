# Action Plan

Step-by-step plan for developing a robust transformer-based trading bot that uses only OHLC data and engineered technical features. The plan is designed to explicitly encode multi-timeframe relationships and is tailored for implementation in Google Colab with an educational GitHub repository.

## Phase 1: Literature Review & Problem Refinement

### 1. Comprehensive Literature Survey
- **Action:** Review the latest research on transformer models in financial forecasting, multi-timeframe encoding strategies, and specialized models (e.g., Temporal Fusion Transformer, FEDformer).
- **Steps:**
  - Gather recent papers (e.g., "Financial Time Series Analysis with Transformer Models" and "Transformers versus LSTMs for Electronic Trading").
  - Identify challenges (non-stationarity, volatility, resolution differences) and effective solutions.
  - Summarize advantages and limitations of transformer-based vs. LSTM-based approaches.
- **Outcome:** A literature review document clarifying the research gap, with citations for key studies.

### 2. Problem Definition & Hypothesis Formation
- **Action:** Define the research question:  
  *"Can explicit timeframe encoding within a transformer improve robustness and accuracy in OHLC-based trading predictions?"*
- **Steps:**
  - Document assumptions and constraints (using only OHLC, volume, and engineered features).
  - Formulate hypotheses regarding the benefit of additional timeframe embeddings.
- **Outcome:** A formal problem statement and research hypotheses.

## Phase 2: Data Acquisition & Preprocessing

### 3. Data Collection
- **Action:** Acquire historical OHLC data along with volume and technical indicator data.
- **Steps:**
  - Identify reliable data sources (Yahoo Finance, Quandl, proprietary APIs).
  - Download data across multiple timeframes (e.g., 1‑min, 5‑min, 15‑min, 1‑hour).
- **Outcome:** Organized raw datasets in the `data/raw/` directory.

### 4. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- **Action:** Clean and preprocess the datasets.
- **Steps:**
  - Use Python (Pandas) to handle missing values and outliers.
  - Normalize OHLC and volume data; compute technical indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, Bollinger Bands).
  - Aggregate data to create multi-timeframe datasets.
- **Outcome:** Processed datasets saved in `data/processed/` with reproducible notebooks.

## Phase 3: Feature Engineering & Timeframe Encoding

### 5. Feature Engineering
- **Action:** Derive features solely from OHLC data.
- **Steps:**
  - Compute standard technical indicators.
  - Engineer additional features such as price momentum and volatility.
- **Outcome:** A comprehensive feature matrix documented for model input.

### 6. Design Timeframe Encoding Strategy
- **Action:** Develop methods to encode relationships between different timeframes.
- **Steps:**
  - Create learnable embeddings for each timeframe (e.g., 5‑min, 15‑min).
  - Include a relative scaling factor to indicate how many shorter candles compose a longer one.
  - Augment positional encoding with a “timeframe identifier.”
- **Outcome:** A modular "timeframe encoding" component ready to integrate into the transformer pipeline.

## Phase 4: Model Architecture Design & Implementation

### 7. Model Architecture Design
- **Action:** Adapt and customize a state-of-the-art transformer architecture.
- **Steps:**
  - Select a base model (e.g., Temporal Fusion Transformer or a custom variant).
  - Modify the input layer to incorporate OHLC features plus timeframe embeddings.
  - Design cross-timeframe attention layers to relate features across resolutions.
  - Document the architecture with diagrams and pseudocode.
- **Outcome:** A detailed design document for the modified transformer architecture.

### 8. Prototype Development in Google Colab
- **Action:** Implement the architecture in a Colab notebook.
- **Steps:**
  - Set up a Colab environment with GPU support.
  - Code data loading and preprocessing pipelines.
  - Implement the transformer with timeframe embeddings using PyTorch or TensorFlow.
  - Modularize code for each component (data ingestion, encoding, attention layers, etc.).
- **Outcome:** A working prototype running end-to-end on a subset of the data.

### 9. Unit Testing and Code Validation
- **Action:** Write tests to ensure each module functions correctly.
- **Steps:**
  - Develop unit tests for data preprocessing functions.
  - Test the embedding layer and attention modules independently.
  - Validate the complete model on a small dataset.
- **Outcome:** A suite of automated tests in the `tests/` directory.

## Phase 5: Experimentation & Evaluation

### 10. Initial Experiments
- **Action:** Train the model and evaluate forecasting performance.
- **Steps:**
  - Define performance metrics (MSE, MAE, directional accuracy, etc.).
  - Run experiments with different configurations (varying embedding dimensions, learning rates, etc.).
  - Utilize validation splits and cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning.
- **Outcome:** Experimental results and visualizations demonstrating the model’s performance.

### 11. Ablation Studies
- **Action:** Isolate the impact of the timeframe encoding module.
- **Steps:**
  - Train baseline transformer models without timeframe encoding.
  - Compare with models that include the explicit encoding.
  - Document performance differences.
- **Outcome:** A set of ablation study results highlighting the benefits of the proposed method.

### 12. Backtesting and Simulated Trading
- **Action:** Integrate the prediction model into a simulated trading environment.
- **Steps:**
  - Develop a backtesting framework using historical price data.
  - Simulate trading based on model predictions and assess profitability.
  - Analyze performance under various market conditions.
- **Outcome:** A trading simulation report with metrics like cumulative returns and Sharpe ratios.

## Phase 6: Documentation, Deployment & Final Prototype

### 13. Documentation and Educational Material
- **Action:** Prepare comprehensive documentation for the project.
- **Steps:**
  - Write a detailed `README.md` covering project overview, setup, and usage instructions.
  - Create educational Jupyter notebooks that explain data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
  - Add clear code comments and markdown explanations.
- **Outcome:** A well-documented GitHub repository that serves as an educational resource.

### 14. Final Prototype Packaging
- **Action:** Refine and package the final prototype.
- **Steps:**
  - Clean up the codebase for reproducibility.
  - Package scripts for automated testing and hyperparameter tuning.
  - Provide instructions for running the project on Colab.
- **Outcome:** A polished final prototype available on GitHub.

### 15. Peer Review & Iteration
- **Action:** Obtain feedback from advisors and peers.
- **Steps:**
  - Present the project in seminars or research group meetings.
  - Incorporate feedback to refine model design, experiments, and documentation.
- **Outcome:** An iteratively improved prototype ready for publication or further research.
